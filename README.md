# Sudoku
Just a small Sudoku game in Python to test how Github works

In case you don't know, the idea of the this game is to complete all boxes with unique numbers and every row and column of the game will not have repeated numbers.

This game was created in Python 3

At the first screen select the difficulty of the game you want to play and after that press Start.

Press the number you want to insert in a box and notice that this number will change in the variable on the top of the screen. After that just press the empty box you want to insert the number you chose.

If the number you insert becomes blue then it's ok, you can insert that number there, but if the number you insert becomes red then you should change it because there is already another box with that same number on the row or column of the box you chose.

The solve button does not work yet. The ideia is to just press it and it will solve the game by itself. I'll try to make a recursion function that will find the solution. Or maybe, Machine Learning, I don't know...I don't think it's necessary, would do it just for the lolz.
