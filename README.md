# Sudoku
Just a small Sudoku game in Python

In case you don't know, the idea of the this game is to complete all boxes with unique numbers and every row and column of the game will not have repeated numbers.

This game was created in Python 3

At the first screen select the difficulty of the game you want to play and after that press Start.

Press the number you want to insert in a box and notice that this number will change in the variable on the top of the screen. After that just press the empty box you want to insert the number you chose.

If the number you insert becomes blue then it's ok, you can insert that number there, but if the number you insert becomes red then you should change it because there is already another box with that same number on the row or column of the box you chose.

Press the solve button so it can be solved by backtrack.
